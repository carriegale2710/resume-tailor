## 6. Private constraints and evidence (NEVER on a resume)

- **Metrics evidence:** `master/metrics-log.csv`. Every number on a CV needs a row; Estimate, Projection and Self-reported rows use the Safe wording column.
- **Narrative material:** `master/narrative-notes.md` (personal story, differentiators, likely objections, target industries).
- **Retired content and the maintenance checklist:** `master/archive.md`.
- **Applications:** `applications/tracker.csv`.

- **Outlier / Scale AI NDA:** may name the platform (Outlier / Scale AI), the processes, the types of tools and the work done. Must not name any project or the client it was for. Tool names (Figma, Google Stitch, v0) are cleared to name. Public reporting links Scale AI to OpenAI as a customer, but nothing public ties your work to any client, so never name one on a resume.
- **WAM 63 (eligibility only):** quote only when an application form asks for WAM or a minimum average. Never put it on a resume or cover letter (the resume uses GPA 6.5/7 for QUT only).
- **AWS → Render:** Employee Creator, Library Portal and Trivia Game were each deployed on AWS (EC2 and S3) (user-stated; no records kept here). The AWS free tier ended, so the demo hosting moved to Render to cut maintenance cost. Interview answer: deployed on AWS, then moved the demos to avoid ongoing cloud spend.
- **Date overlaps:** the 2-week internship was part of the \_nology program, so it sits inside the program dates. Remarkable Tech (Mar–May 2025) is where the aBeauté co-founder work was done, so those overlap by design; aBeauté has been on hold since May 2025.
- **Interview stories (STAR):** TODO one each for: validation fix after PR feedback; Library Portal team integration; GAIA architecture trade-off; accessibility business case to co-founders.
- **Anything discussable but not publishable:** TODO.
- **MATES Abroad reference letter (third-party evidence):** the program coordinator oversaw the five months, cited mentee feedback reports describing the support as invaluable with a significant impact on adjustment, and credited emotional intelligence, time management and communication. Recommends me for client-facing and people-focused work. Use for retail, customer-service, graduate-program and cover-letter angles, not as resume adjectives. TODO: record the coordinator's name, title and contact, and whether they agreed to be listed.
- **Gapmash reference letter (third-party evidence):** the internship required team work on a product review, research synthesis, design strategy and analysis, wireframing and prototyping. The referee described me as hard-working, collaborative, able to multi-task and finish tasks on time, honest, friendly and positive, and able to view problems from a unique perspective. Use for cover letters, interviews and reference requests ("my internship supervisor described me as..."), never as resume bullets (adjectives). TODO: record the referee's name, title and contact in a private reference list, and whether they agreed to be listed.
- **Do not claim (from a pasted older answer):** "100% test coverage" (no coverage figure; say "automated test suite"); "CI/CD" (CI is evidenced in the repos; auto-deploy on push for Employee Creator, Trivia Game and Library Portal is user-stated with no records, so say "auto-deploy" and be ready to explain the setup); "12 weeks" (use 4 months for \_nology); "QA pipelines" (say "prompts, rubrics and checklists").
